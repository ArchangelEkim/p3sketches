# p3Sketches

This is a collection of my code samples made using the Processing applet. 
Some code is influenced by Daniel Shiffman's work in P3 from his Youtube channel the Coding Train.
The purpose of using processing for me is to create computer generated artwork.
Examples are found in each subdirectory of topics.
